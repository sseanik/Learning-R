**R**:

Variables:

* variables cannot start with a number or underscore
* variable = x (same as Python)
* variable2 <- 10 (another way to set variables)

* variable <- variable2 <- variable3 <- 20 (will set all variables to 20)
* assign('nameOfVariable', value) (Another way to assign a variable)
* rm(nameOfVariable) will remove the value from nameOfVariable which will also remove it from memory
